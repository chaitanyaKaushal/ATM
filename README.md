"Defending against advanced attack vectors on Biometric Identification and Authentication Systems"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I participated in National Level Cyber Security Grand-Challenge with a team of 4 people (including me).
We focused on securing money transactions that take place using ATMs using Biometric Security as well as protecting the transactions from Biometric Breaches.

My contribution to the project was to suggest an encryption algorithm which could make TRIPLE DES more secure for communication between banks and ATM machines as well as how the hardware and software be interlinked with each other to show pillar-bridge relationship.
The channel was so well encrypted that even sensitive biometric information can be transmitted with no fear.

The TRIPLE DES Encryption was aided with Biometric Authentification ,2D Haar-Wavelet Transform and Machine Learning.
The detailed approach is given in the project.
Enjoy !
